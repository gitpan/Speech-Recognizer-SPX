Installation
------------

This module requires Sphinx2 0.5 or later, available from
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/.  To build and install
Sphinx-II, unpack the sphinx2 tarball, change into the directory
created and run:

  ./configure
  make
  # now become root, or some user with write access to /usr/local
  make install

On GNU/Linux systems, you may need to add /usr/local/lib to the end of
your /etc/ld.so.conf file and re-run /sbin/ldconfig as root.

Once you have installed Sphinx2, you can build and install
Speech::Recognizer::SPX.  To do this, change into the
Speech-Recognizer-SPX directory, and run:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test # this may fail if you have no working audio device
  make install

If any failures are reported by 'make test' that are not
audio-related, please report them by e-mail to the address above.

This module has only been tested on GNU/Linux.  It is likely to work
on free 4.4BSD-derived operating systems as well, but I have not
tested this.  Status on other Unix-like operating systems supported by
Sphinx-II, or Microsoft Windows, is unknown.

Demos and examples
------------------

Several example programs are included in this distribution:

tty-continuous: Basically the same sa the 'sphinx2-continuous' program
	included with the Sphinx-II distribution.

turtle-demo: Basically the same as the 'sphinx2-demo' program included
	with the Sphinx-II distribution.

server-demo: Demo of using a separate process to do recognition.

fe-test: Demo of the feature extraction model.

select-cad: Demo of using select() on audio devices in conjunction
	with Audio::SPX::Continuous.
